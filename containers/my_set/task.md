# 3. Custom Set Implementations and Performance


# Objective: 

Gain deeper insights into set implementations by creating 
custom set-like classes and comparing their performance to built-in sets.

# Exercise:
Implement a custom class MySet that mimics the basic functionality of a set:
- [done] adding elements 
- [done] checking for membership 
- [done] implement iteration capabilities
- [done] performing simple set operations: intersection

You can use lists or dictionaries internally to store the elements.

Create instances of MySet and built-in set with a reasonable number of elements.

Perform various operations (e.g., adding elements, membership testing, ) on both MySet and set instances.

Use the timeit module to measure and compare the execution times of these operations for both implementations.

Analyze the performance differences and discuss the potential reasons behind them, considering 
factors like underlying data structures, algorithmic optimizations, and implementation specifics.
